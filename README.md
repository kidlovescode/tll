# tll

A new Flutter application. The codes of GameBox platform. The name is 'tll' just for short. In the future I will rename it later. 


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
Warning: A code may work independently. 
main.dart is not work. I don't know why. But you can use the mainminigame.dart for running the program to see the design pattern. 
Each design pattern has a core profile, however, it may call to other profiles. 
Some codes may be quite similar to others and may share the similar other codes. Refactoring codes are important issue to deal with when time comes. 

Enjoy!!!
